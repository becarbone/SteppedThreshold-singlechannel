# SteppedThreshold-singlechannel
This is a macro derived from the one simply labeled "SteppedThreshold". This one only does one channel at a time (though is easily modifiable to repeat), and creates an array with comma separated values for puncta number and area. This is primarily used for very dense areas of puncta with unreliable background.
